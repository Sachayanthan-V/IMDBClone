|  TEST NAME: IMDB |
--------------------

Problem statement
======================
Create a mini IMDB clone app. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript 
(you can use any css framework like Bootstrap).


Instructions : 
======================
Use the OMDB API: https://www.omdbapi.com/

KEY = 6b786f7b
http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey]&

http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=6b786f7b&?t=type%3Dmovie

http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=6b786f7b&i=type%3D%22movie%22

http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=type%3D%22movie%22
http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=6b786f7b&i=movie
http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=movie


Features (No need for extra features, just make the listed features):
=====================================================================
Home Page : 
==============
Search any movie from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
Each search result of the movie should have a favourite button, clicking on which the movie should be added to “My favourite movies” (a list).
On clicking any particular search result (any movie), open a new page with more information about that movie (movie page)

Movie Page : 
==============
Should show information about the movie like its name, photo, plot, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).


My favourite movies Page : 
===========================
Display a list of all the favourite movies.
Make this list persistent (should have the same number of movies before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).
Remove from favourites button: Each movie should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that movie from the list.
